# Binary Search Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Binary Search algorithm. Binary Search is a classic algorithm used to efficiently find a target value within a sorted sequence or array. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the target value until it isolates the value or determines that it's not present.

## Overview

Binary Search is preferred for sorted arrays due to its time complexity of O(log n), making it significantly faster than linear search algorithms for large datasets. This implementation assumes the input array (`arr`) is sorted in ascending order.

## Implementation Details

The `binary_search` function takes two parameters:
- `arr`: A sorted list of elements where the target value will be searched.
- `target`: The value to be searched within the `arr`.

The function returns:
- The index of `target` in `arr` if `target` is present.
- `-1` if `target` is not found in `arr`.

Here is the Python code for the `binary_search` function:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1
```

## Example Usage

You can use the `binary_search` function as follows:

```python
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
target = 16

result = binary_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Element found at index {result}")
else:
    print("Element not found")
```

In this example:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `target` is the value we want to find within `arr`.
- `binary_search(arr, target)` returns the index of `target` if found, or `-1` if not found.
